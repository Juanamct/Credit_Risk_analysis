# Credit_Risk_analysis

# Objective
Apply various supervised machine learning algorithms and resampling to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk.  Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, 
  1. oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms 
  2. undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm 
  3. use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm
  4. compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. 
  5. evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
